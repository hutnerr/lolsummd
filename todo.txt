add region dropdown
add a update all regions button/base region
update the backend to account for the region instead of only using NA
scrape the champion pictures so i can display those
finish styling the rest of the website, especially the result and input
make it so that they boxes stay full on submit, maybe the page doesn't refresh, and instead it just updates whats there
error handling if a user couldn't be found
check if account exists on add?
ensure i cant add duplicate accounts?
on account submit, go back to the input
maybe i can set the tag to the default of the region like #NA1
cache the combined result on a timer to try and reduce the amount of requests when swapping between webpages
figure out why i can scroll left and right
